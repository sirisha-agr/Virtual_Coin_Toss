# Virtual_Coin_Toss
## Overview:
The Virtual Coin Toss is a simple Python-based program that simulates flipping a coin. This project helps users understand randomization, loops, and counters while providing an interactive experience.
## Objectives:
- Simulate a coin toss using Python's random module.<br>
- Allow users to perform multiple tosses in a single session.<br>
- Track and display the counts and percentages of Heads and Tails.<br>
- Provide an interactive experience with restart/exit options.<br>
## Features:
✅ Random Coin Flip using random.choice()<br>
✅ Multiple Tosses (user-specified number of flips)<br>
✅ Result Tracking (counts & percentages of Heads/Tails)<br>
✅ Interactive User Input (restart or exit after session)<br>
## Technologies Used
- Python (Core logic)<br>
- Random Module (random.choice() for coin flip)<br>
- Loops & Counters (Tracking results)<br>
- User Input Handling (input() for interaction)<br>
